## Machine Learning </br>
Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

### Types of Machine Learning : </br>
Machine Learning is broadly classfied as 2 types. </br>
1.Supervised Machine Learning </br>
2.Unsupervised Machine Learning </br>

## Supervised Machine Learning </br>
Supervised Machine Learning algorithms build using labelled dataset. Labelled dataset means each input contains it's own output. Supervised Models will learn continuosly by correcting the model's output with original output.

[5.K-Nearest Neighbour](https://github.com/JeyrajK/Machine-Learning-basics-from-scratch/tree/master/KNN)


## Unsupervised Machine Learning </br>
Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms uses only inputs (unlabelled dataset) to build their model. It mainly classifies or groups the data points into different groups.
