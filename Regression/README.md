## Linear Regression :
   Linear regression is a statistical approach for modelling relationship between a dependent variable with a given set of 
independent variables.
dependent variables -  response , independent variables -  features

Task is to find a line which fits best in features.so that we can predict the response for any new feature values.
This line is called regression line.

The equation of regression line is represented as:
###  h(x)  = Θ(0) + Θ(1)X
Where , h(x) represents the predicted response value , Θ(0) and Θ(1) are regression coefficients and represent y-intercept and slope of regression line respectively.
